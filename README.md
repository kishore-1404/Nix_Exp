# NixCfg - My Nix Configuration

## Description
This repository contains my personal NixOS and Home Manager configurations. It uses the Nix flakes system to manage dependencies and configurations in a reproducible way.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed [NixOS](https://nixos.org/download.html) or have Nix package manager installed on another Linux distribution.
- You have enabled flakes by adding `experimental-features = nix-command flakes` to your Nix configuration.

## Installation
To use these configurations, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kishore-1404/nixcfg.git
   cd nixcfg
   ```

2. Apply the NixOS configuration (on NixOS systems):
   ```sh
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#nixos
   ```

3. Apply the Home Manager configuration:
   ```sh
   home-manager switch --flake .#kishore@nixos
   ```

## Usage

### NixOS System Management
- Rebuild and switch to the new system configuration:
  ```sh
  sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#nixos
  ```

- Build but don't activate (for testing):
  ```sh
  sudo nixos-rebuild build --flake .#nixos
  ```

### Home Manager
- Apply Home Manager configuration changes:
  ```sh
  home-manager switch --flake .#kishore@nixos
  ```

### Configuring System Services
System-wide services can be configured in the appropriate module under `hosts/nixos/modules/`.

### Adding Development Tools
Development-specific tools and configurations can be added to `home/kishore/modules/dev/`.
